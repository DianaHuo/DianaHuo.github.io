<p><strong>In this part, you will need to write about your project’s topic, process and results. The following questions will serve as references to your project report.<br>What is my project?</strong>  </p>
<p>“Visual analysis of Los Angeles city employee payroll regarding overtime pay&amp; budget&amp; full/part time jobs”<br>What are my research target and research method?<br>I hope that through this research, I can go through LA city employee payroll carefully, find out some room for improvement, and give some constructive suggestions on how the government can save more funds while increasing its efficiency. The research uses tableau to conduct exploratory analysis.</p>
<p><strong>What was the biggest challenge that I encountered? How did I overcome it?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge that I encountered was to find a dataset for my research after mastering basic techniques of using Tableau.  I spent three days looking for a suitable dataset on websites like Kaggle and Data. World. There were hundreds of datasets available online, but it was really hard to find a dataset with enough information and numbers that I could analyze, not to mention that I had limited knowledge in many areas, and I hoped to find one that was highly related to economics. Moreover, I was a little confused when I looked through a dataset, having no ideas about the topics that I could investigated. So, I asked my instructor for some advices. He gave me some directions and suggested that I could find datasets on Data LA. After spending another night looking through many datasets on the website, I downloaded three to four datasets and tried to think of some perspectives that I could focus on for each dataset and finally chose the city employee payroll in LA as my research dataset.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most interesting part of my project?</strong> </p>
<p>The most interesting part of my project was organizing data using Tableau. There were 358,010 rows in total in my original dataset. At first, it was impossible for me to imagine how could I organize those data into simple tables and graphs. However, after importing my data into Tableau, it automatically sorted all the categories into measure and dimensions. And I needed to check and change some categories if Tableau made some errors when recognizing them. After that, I could drag the categories and variables into “rows” and “columns” to draw graphs or make tables. Moreover, I was able to decide the calculations done by Tableau by choosing “sum”, “average”, and so on. If I wanted to see a specific group of data, I just need to use the filter to filter out unwanted data. The usefulness of Tableau really surprised me, and I did enjoy the process of organizing all those data into beautiful and practical graphs.</p>
<p><strong>What are my research result(s) and conclusion(s)?</strong></p>
<p>Research results and conclusions are all on the doc “tableau research report”.</p>
<p><strong>What have I learned in this project? Anything more I want to add?</strong> </p>
<p>Through this project, I learned how to use Tableau to organize data, to draw graphs and make tables, to create interactive dashboard, and to add some basic calculated field. Moreover, I knew the resources and the methods for finding suitable datasets and formed a problem-oriented way of thinking that helped me find out questions that I wanted to do research on. Also, I learned about the structure of the government and the details of payments for city employees. More importantly, I got to know how to analyze the graph and form my own opinion based on the data, the reality, and the knowledge I learned in other classes, such as economics and statistics. </p>

<p>Instructed by: Tianyu Feng</p>
<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction:"></a>Introduction:</h3><p>City employees play important roles in the operation of a city, and their salaries make up a large proportion of government funds. In California, employee compensation consumes 84% of the state revenues (California Policy Center). So, it’s necessary for government to look through employee’s payment and find effective ways to make best use of the funds. Using real data of LA government from 2013 to 2018, analyses with respect to overtime pay, budget, and full/part time jobs are conducted using tableau. And by comparing the results by department and job class, suggestions on how to improve the efficiency are given, accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="Results-and-analysis"><a href="#Results-and-analysis" class="headerlink" title="Results and analysis:"></a>Results and analysis:</h3><p><strong>Dashboard 1:</strong></p>
<p><img src="/2019/09/17/Project-Summary/1.png" alt="1.jpg"></p>
<p>The graph is composed of five pie chart which show the proportion of base pay, other payments (including all payments except for base pay and overtime pay), and overtime pay from 2013 to 2017. As we can see from the graph, the proportion colored in brown refers to overtime pay, and the percentage of overtime pay among total payments is shown on the upper-left corner of each pie chart. I choose to use the percentage instead of nominal money in consideration of the inflation rate and number of employees. According to the data, overtime pay makes up larger and larger proportion every year, so government should pay more attention to the issue of employees working overtime.</p>
<p><strong>Dashboard 2:</strong></p>
<p><img src="/2019/09/17/Project-Summary/2.png" alt="2.jpg"></p>
<p>The chart on top shows the TOP 5 overtime work department in 2017. The percentage refers to the percentage of overtime payment in total payments. As we can see from the chart, fire department has the highest percentage among the five departments, with a percentage of 31.99%. The proportion of overtime payment is extremely high—it makes up nearly a third of the payments for fire department. All other four department–airports department, building and safty department, public works-street services department, and water and power department, have percentages around 10% to 15%. </p>
<p>Considering the high proportion of overtime payment in fire department, I keep investigating which job class in fire department has the hightest percentage for overtime payment. The chart on the bottom shows the TOP 5 overtime work job class in fire department in 2017. By changing the filter “year”, I am able to see the change of percentage of overtime payment for all five job classes. While the percentage for fireboat pilot and fire helicoper pilot decrease overtime, that of fire captain remains on an upward trend.</p>
<p><strong>Dashboard 3:</strong></p>
<p><img src="/2019/09/17/Project-Summary/3.png" alt="3.jpg"></p>
<p>From the graph on top, we can see the percentage of overtime payment for fireboat pilot (colored in blue) increases from 2013 to 2016, but decreases significantly in 2017. In contrary, the percentage of overtime payment for fire captain (colored in orange) keeps increasing in this four year period. According to what I observe in the first graph, I speculate that the government may already realize the overtime work issue and take actions to solve the problem. </p>
<p>Then, I focus on the distribution of overtime pay for fireboat pilot (graph on the lower-left corner) by year to find out how the government decreases percentage of overtime payment. According to the five boxplots, the median for overtime payment decreases a lot in 2017, indicating an overall decrease in overtime payment in that year. There are 7 fireboat pilots in 2016, but only 6 of them are left in 2017. I suspect that the workload for fireboat pilot decreases in general, and government decides to hire fewer fireboat pilot, which may affect the percentage of overtime payments. Also, it is highly possible that there are other changes made by the government to decrease the overtime payment that are not seen on the graph. </p>
<p>I also draw a plot to see the distribution of overtime pay for fire captain, whose percentage of overtime payments increrases every year. From the graph on the lower-right corner, we can conclude that the median for overtime pay doesn’t change a lot from 2013 to 2017. Another obvious characteristic of the graph is that there are lots of outliers, which means there are some people who earn much more overtime payment than average, and some people earn much less overtime payment than average. So, there’s uneven distribution of workload for fire captain. If fire department can assign the work more evenly, the overtime payment may decrease a lot. </p>
<p><strong>Dashboard 4:</strong></p>
<p><img src="/2019/09/17/Project-Summary/4.png" alt="4.jpg"></p>
<p>Budget is also a big concern for government. The dashboard shows general information about LA government’s budget and actual expenses. The table on top shows the TOP 20 overbudget department in 2017. The numbers is calculated by SUM (projected annual salary)/SUM (total payments). Numbers colored in red indicate overbudget, whereas numbers colored in black indicate underbudget. As we can see in the table, fire department, water and power department, employee relations board department, public works-street services department, and airports department are five departments with highest level of overbudget. Most of the departments are actually underbudget. </p>
<p>The graph on the lower-left is a side-by-side bar charts that compares projected annual salaries (budget) and total payments (actual expenses) from 2013 to 2017. Projected annual salaries are colored in blue, and total payments are colored in orange. There ‘s gradual increase for both projected annual salaries and total payments overtime, and total payments are always higher than projected annual salaries, but the difference between them is almost the same each year. </p>
<p>The last graph shows the distribution of overbudget and underbudget by year. The budget on y-axis is calculated as total payment/ projected annual salary (for each individual). If this value is larger than 1 (overbudget), the corresponding point is in red. If the value is less than 1 (underbudget), the corresponding point is in black.</p>
<p><strong>Dashboard 5:</strong></p>
<p><img src="/2019/09/17/Project-Summary/5.png" alt="5.jpg"></p>
<p>The graph on top shows the projected payments and total payments for five overbudget department in 2013 and 2017. The graph on the bottom shows the projected payments and total payments for five underbudget department in 2013 and 2017. Blue bars represent projected annual saliries in total for each department, while orange bars represent total payments in total for each department. The percentage shown in the graph is calculated as (SUM([Total Payments])-SUM([Projected Annual Salary]))/SUM([Total Payments]), which shows the proportion of the expenses that exceeds the budget. </p>
<p>I would suggest that government should inform overbudget departments, like fire department, water and power department , and police department, that they spend too much and that they should manage their budget better in the future. It will result in a reduction in actual expenses. As for the underbudget department, the government can cut some of their budget, too. The fact that they are underbudget shows that the government overestimate their expenses, so the government can save more money without lowering their efficiency. </p>
<p><strong>Dashboard 6:</strong></p>
<p><img src="/2019/09/17/Project-Summary/6.png" alt="6.jpg"></p>
<p>According to the graph on the upper-left corner, the percentage of overtime payment in total payments for fire fighters decreases since 2015, but the percentage of overtime payment is still pretty high. The five box plots below the graph show the distribution of overtime pay for firefighters by year. While the median for overtime pay remains almost the same, there are lots of outliers, which reveal the fact many firefighters get an overtime pay much higher than average. The problem can be solved by adjust firefighters’ work schedule to make sure an even distribution. Another abnormal fact is that every year, there are a few people getting an extremely high overtime pay. It is possible that there are some loopholes in the system, and some people get unfair advantage. Government need to check and find out the reason for such a high overtime pay. </p>
<p>Longevity bonus pay is a contractual agreement to provide annual compensation to an employee based on seniority (business dictionary). As we can see from the graph on the top right corner, the longevity bonus for firefighters remains an increasing trend from 2013 to 2017. We can look closer at the distribution of logevity bonus for firefighters on the graph at lower right corner. From 2013 to 2014, the median (50th percentile) increases significantly, which means there are less people getting a longevity bonus pay between 0k and 1k, which indicates that the government hires less new firefighters. From 2015 to 2016, the median decreases from 2k to 1k, which shows an increase in the amount of people earning a longevity pay below 1k. This may result from government hiring more firefighters. While the range between the median and Q3 in 2016 increases a lot, indicating less firefighters have longevity bonus pay between 2k and 3k as comparing to 2015. The range between median and Q3 is enlarged again in 2017, and the range between Q3 and maximum decreases. So, we can infer that fewers firefighters earn a longevity bonus pay between 1k and 3k, and more firefighters earn a longevity bonuss pay between 5k and 7k comparing to 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Dashboard 7:</strong></p>
<p><img src="/2019/09/17/Project-Summary/7.png" alt="7.jpg"></p>
<p>All four graphs in the dashboard are about payments of full-time jobs and part-time jobs. Bars colored in blue represent full-time jobs, while bars in gray represent part-time jobs. The graph on the top-left corner shows total payments for full-time jobs and part time jobs from 2013 to 2017. While the total payments for full-time jobs increases overtime, that of part time job remains the same. This indicates that on average, the amount of part time jobs in LA government doesn’t change or decreases as time passes. The graph on the top-right corner shows the distribution of full-time jobs and part time jobs by department. For most of the departments in LA government, total payments for part time jobs are too little compare to that of full-time jobs. There’s an exception for recreation and park department—payments for part time jobs make up nearly a half of its total payments. To look closer at the part time jobs in recreation and park department, I draw a graph to see the payments for full-time jobs and part time jobs in it, noticing that there’s an increasing trend for its part time jobs. According to County of Los Angeles, recreation and park department is responsible for acquiring, developing and maintaining County parks, gardens, golf courses, trails and open space areas. I think one reason for so many part time jobs in this department is that many jobs in the department don’t need employees to work for a whole day, such as recreation coordinator, recreation assistant, and recreation instructor. Also, this department is responsible for a really large area, so it’s better to hire several par time employees locally, instead of having a full-time employee to go all around the city.</p>
<p>The graph on the lower-right corner shows a more detailed comparison for payments of full-time jobs and part time jobs. It is obvious that part time jobs have much lower base pay, longevity bonus pay, lump sum pay, and hourly or event pay. However, most of the departments still prefer full-time employees. I suspect that they may find the time cost of hiring and managing part time employees higher than the money they save. But for department that has similar situation like recreation and park department, hiring more part time employees is definitely a good choice.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion:"></a>Conclusion:</h3><p>The research focused on Los Angeles government’s overtime payment, budget and actual expenses, and full/part time jobs. Overtime payment is a big concern for LA government. Government should reinforce the management of overtime work and make sure the even distribution of work to prevent some of its employees having unfair advantages. Budget is also an issue that should not be overlooked by the government. Instead of cutting the budget overall, the government should focus on some top overbudget and underbudget department and make changes on their budgets. Although most of the employees in the government are full-time employees, hiring more part time employees and reducing unnecessary full-time jobs can save a lot of funds while maintaining the efficiency.</p>
